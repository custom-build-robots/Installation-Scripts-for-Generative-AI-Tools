## Important Note on Docker Usage

While Docker is widely recognized as a powerful and flexible tool for containerized deployments, only the `install_ollama_web_ui.sh` script uses Docker. This is because, for the other tools, Docker's internal network configuration posed challenges in making them accessible over the local network to other users and PCs for the autor. 

For tools like Flowise, n8n, and Ollama, the scripts use local installations without Docker to ensure they are exposed directly to your intranet, providing seamless access for all devices within the same local network.

Docker is still leveraged for the Ollama Web UI installation, where its features align perfectly with the requirements of that specific tool.

If you'd like to adapt these scripts to run all tools in Docker containers, I would be thrilled to see your contributions and ideas!

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `ubuntu_install.sh`
- **Purpose**: Prepares your Ubuntu system with essential tools and dependencies for generative AI tools and development.
- **Hint**: The installation methods used in these scripts assume that your system is equipped with a NVIDIA RTX graphics card like a RTX 4090, A6000 or even better.
- **Details**:
  - Updates and upgrades system packages.
  - Installs common utilities and developer tools like `mc` and `curl`.
  - Ensures the system is ready for advanced AI installations and configurations.

### 2. `install_ollama.sh`
- **Purpose**: Installs Ollama, a versatile platform for running and managing generative AI language models locally.
- **Details**:
  - Installs the latest version of Ollama, preparing your system to leverage advanced AI models like LLaMA.
  - Enables local deployment of AI models without relying on cloud infrastructure.

### 3. `install_ollama_web_ui.sh`
- **Purpose**: Deploys the Open Web UI for Ollama, providing a browser-based interface for interacting with generative AI models.
- **Details**:
  - Installs and configures the Open Web UI with support for Ollama models.
  - Makes the web interface accessible over the local network for seamless AI model management and interaction.

### 4. `install_n8n.sh`
- **Purpose**: Installs and configures n8n, a powerful workflow automation tool with integrations for AI-based solutions.
- **Details**:
  - Installs n8n globally using `npm`.
  - Sets up n8n as a systemd service for persistent execution.
  - Secures access with basic authentication and enables network-wide availability for AI-enhanced automation.

### 5. `install_Flowise.sh`
- **Purpose**: Installs and configures Flowise, a visual interface for building and managing AI workflows.
- **Details**:
  - Installs Flowise globally using `npm`.
  - Configures it as a systemd service for automatic startup.
  - Runs Flowise on a specified port (`3001`) and makes it accessible over the local network.
